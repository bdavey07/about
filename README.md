# My About Page
This project is being developed as a portfolio to showcase my hobbies and projects, and to start learning about web development. For this page I used the Astro framework for the first time. Credit to https://github.com/immois/astro-zen as the template I started with, I added a few features, some subpages and tailored the template to my needs.
